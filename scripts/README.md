# Description of the process

## Parsing of the tables

### links.txt
- `pl_from` -> Id of the "from" page of this link
- (`pl_namespace`) -> We keep only if equals 0 (= namespace of the "from" page of this link)
- `pl_target_id` -> Target of this link  (foreign key to `linktarget`)

### targets.txt
- `lt_id` -> Id of this link (index)
- (`lt_ns`) -> We keep only if equals 0 (= namespace of the targeted page)
- `lt_title` -> Title of the targeted page

### pages.txt
- `page_id` -> Id of the page
- (`page_namespace`) -> We keep only if equals 0 (= namespace of this page)
- `page_title` -> Title of this page
- `page_is_redirect` -> Boolean wether this page is a redirect
- Ignore the eight following

### redirects.txt
- `rd_from` -> Id of the page from which we are redirected
- (`rd_namespace`) -> We keep only if equals 0 (= namespace of the page we are redirected to)
- `rd_title` -> Title of the page we are redirected to
- Ignore the two following

## Joining the tables

### redirects.with_ids.txt (replace_titles_in_redirects_file.py)
Replaces for each redirection, `rd_title` with the targetted `page_id` by matching on `page_title`.
The targetted page_id is then computed as a redirect recursively, until we get on a "final" page.
- `rd_from` -> The id of the page we are redirected from
- `page_id` -> The id of the page we get to following redirections recursively

### targets.with_ids.txt (replace_titles_and_redirects_in_targets_file.py)
Replaces, for each linktarget, `lt_title` with the targetted `page_id` by matching on `page_title`.
We then compute the "final" page obtained from this page following redirection, with the file `redirects.with_ids.txt`.
- `lt_id` -> Id of this link
- `page_id` -> The id of the page this link is pointing to, after having followed all redirections

### links.with_ids.txt (replace_titles_and_redirects_in_links_file.py)
Replaces, for each pagelink, `lt_id` with the targetted `page_id` by joining with `links.with_ids.txt`.
- `pl_from` -> Id of the "from" page, after having followed all redirections
- `page_id` -> Id of the "to" page, after having followed all redirections

### page.pruned.txt (prune_pages_file.py)
Prunes the pages file by removing pages which are marked as redirects but have no corresponding redirect in the redirects file.
TEMPORARY DISABLED as it removed too many pages

## Sorting, grouping, and counting the links

### links.sorted_by_XXX_id.txt
Then we sorts the `links.with_ids.txt` according to the first "source" id, into
the file `links.sorted_by_source_id.txt`, and according to the second "target" id 
into the file `links.sorted_by_target_id.txt`.

### links.grouped_by_XXX_id.txt
Then, we use those two files to *GROUP BY* the links by source and by target.
The file `links.grouped_by_source_id.txt` is like this
- `pl_from` -> Id of the "from" page
- `targets` -> A `|`-separated string of the ids the "from" page targets

The file `links.grouped_by_target_id.txt` is like this
- `froms` -> A `|`-separated string of the ids of the pages targeting the "target" page
- `pl_target` -> Id of the "target" page

### links.with_counts.txt (combine_grouped_links_files.py)
We merge the two files `links.grouped_by_XXX_id.txt` creating the following file
- `page_id` -> The id of the page
- `outgoing_links_count` -> The number of outgoing links from this page
- `incoming_links_count` -> The number of incoming links to this page
- `outgoing_links` -> A `|`-separated string of the ids of the pages this page links to
- `incoming_links` -> A `|`-separated string of the ids of the pages linking to this page

## Making the database
To make the database, we copy directly the contents of the three files into the corresponding tables
- `links.with_counts.txt`
- `page.pruned.txt`
- `redirects.with_ids.txt`
